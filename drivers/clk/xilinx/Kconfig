config XILINX_VCU
	tristate "Xilinx VCU logicoreIP Init"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM && COMMON_CLK
	select REGMAP_MMIO
	help
	  Provides the driver to enable and disable the isolation between the
	  processing system and programmable logic part by using the logicoreIP
	  register set. This driver also configures the frequency based on the
	  clock information from the logicoreIP register set.

	  If you say yes here you get support for the logicoreIP.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xlnx_vcu.

	tristate "Clock driver for Xilinx Alveo clocking wizard"
	depends on FPGA_XRT_LIB
	select XRT_CLK_FREQ
	select XRT_CLK_UCS
	help
	  Select this option to enable the Alveo clock driver. When FPGA
	  manager programs Alveo FPGA, it needs to set the clock frequency.
	  This driver provides the interfaces to configure the fclock
	  frequency.

config XRT_CLK_FREQ
	tristate "Driver for Xilinx Alveo clock frequency counter"
	depends on FPGA_XRT_LIB
	depends on XRT_CLK_WIZ
	help
	  Select this option to enable the Alveo clock frequency counter
	  driver. The Alveo clock frequency counter indicates if the clock
	  is configured correctly. This driver provides the function to
	  read the frequency counter.

config XRT_CLK_UCS
	tristate "Driver for Xilinx Alveo user clock subsystem controller"
	depends on FPGA_XRT_LIB
	depends on XRT_CLK_WIZ
	help
	  Select this option to enable the Alveo user clock subsystem (UCS)
	  controller driver. After configuring the clock frequency, the UCS
	  controller needs to be enabled. This driver provides the function
	  to enable UCS.
